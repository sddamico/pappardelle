// Width helpers for the ticket-rail profile emoji.
//
// The reason this file exists at all: Ink measures and draws an emoji with two
// *different* width functions, and for one class of emoji they disagree.
//
//   - Layout (Yoga) sizes a <Text> box at `widest-line` (Ink's bundled
//     `string-width`), which reports ✨ (U+2728) as 2 cells.
//   - The cell-writer (ink/build/output.js) advances by 2 columns for a
//     character only when `char.fullWidth || char.value.length > 1`.
//
// A single-BMP, default-emoji-presentation symbol (✨ U+2728, ⭐ U+2B50,
// ✅ U+2705, ⚡ U+26A1 …) is one code unit (`value.length === 1`) and is not
// East-Asian-wide (`fullWidth === false`), so the writer draws it as **1** cell
// and pads the 2-cell layout box with a trailing space. Astral emoji
// (🍝 U+1F35D, a surrogate pair of length 2) and VS16-qualified emoji
// (⚙️ U+2699 U+FE0F, a second cell) clear the writer's checks; text-default
// symbols Ink lays out as 1 cell (❤ U+2764, ✂ U+2702) match the writer. None
// of those get padded.
//
// `SpaceListItem` uses `railEmojiIsInkPadded` to decide whether to emit its own
// separator: when Ink already pads, that pad cell *is* the separator, so a
// second explicit space would double it up (STA-1565).
//
// The pad is not just cosmetic, though: it is a real character the terminal
// draws *in addition to* the two columns it paints the glyph in, so the emitted
// row runs one column past the box it was laid out in. STA-1861 closes that gap
// at the source: `resolveEmojiSlot` runs the glyph through
// `normalizeRailEmoji`, which appends U+FE0F so the writer advances the full
// two cells and leaves nothing behind. Rail emoji therefore no longer expand
// past their layout; arbitrary text (issue titles) still can, which is why
// `inkRenderPad` remains in use for those.
//
// Both sides are measured the way Ink itself measures them (`widest-line` for
// the layout box, `@alcalzone/ansi-tokenize` for the writer) rather than
// pappardelle's own (newer) `string-width`, whose width tables differ from
// Ink's bundled copy for exactly these symbols. The render test in
// `components/space-list-item-emoji.test.ts` exercises real Ink and flags any
// future drift between the two libraries.

 * one character more than its layout box is wide. Inside a bordered frame that
 * surplus column pushes the closing border past the pane edge, and the terminal
 * wraps it onto a line of its own: the phantom blank row under a ✨ profile in
 * the new-session picker (STA-1861).
 *
 * Appending U+FE0F takes the grapheme to `value.length === 2`, so the writer
 * consumes the cell instead of skipping it. VS16 is what the glyph already
 * renders as (these are emoji-presentation-by-default symbols), so nothing about
 * the drawn character changes, only how many cells Ink admits to using.
 *
 * The guard re-measures rather than trusting the rule, so a sequence a variation
 * selector can't rescue falls through untouched instead of gaining a stray code
 * point. Scoped to `railEmojiIsInkPadded`: text-presentation
 * defaults (❤ U+2764, ✂ U+2702) are *not* padded, and real terminals paint them
 * one cell wide exactly as Ink lays them out; widening those would change the

 *   - `''` — the slot exists but this row has nothing to put in it. Two spaces

 *
 * `text` is the *normalized* glyph, so the slot is the single place a rail
 * emoji is made safe to draw; nothing downstream has to know about U+FE0F.

 * it: the columns the terminal paints (`widest-line` on the configured glyph,
 * the measure that matched a real tmux pane during STA-1861's TUI QA) minus the
 * columns Ink's writer emits for what we hand it. Normalization drives this to
 * zero for the whole padded class, but callers that right-align content still
 * subtract it, so an emoji no variation selector can rescue can't silently push

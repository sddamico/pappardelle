A TUI for multi-clauding without losing your marbles.

You type a description, it reads or creates an issue in Linear, Jira or beads, spawns a configured git worktree, builds a PR/MR, and starts a Claude Code session alongside a companion pane (gitui by default, configurable to any command) — all wired together in a 3-pane tmux layout you can navigate with simple, customizable keystrokes.

## 1. Installation and Getting Started

The fastest way to get set up is with `/init-pappardelle`.

Add the marketplace:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add chardigio/pappardelle
```

Install the plugin. This installs four skills — `/init-pappardelle` (setup wizard), `/update-pappardelle` (update to latest), `/configure-pappardelle` (interactive config editor), and `/sous-chef` (optional workspace coordinator):

```bash
claude plugin install pappardelle@pappardelle-marketplace
```

Run the setup wizard from any repo where you want to use Pappardelle. This installs pappardelle configures your .pappardelle.yml:

```bash
claude /init-pappardelle
```

For manual installation, see [Section 8: Reference](#8-reference). For the full config format, see the [configuration reference](pappardelle-config.md).

### Launch Pappardelle:

```bash
pappardelle
```

## 2. Understanding tmux in Pappardelle

### The 3-pane layout

When you launch `pappardelle`, it creates a tmux session with three panes:

- **Left pane** shows the ticket rail. This is where you navigate workspaces, create new ones, and trigger actions.
- **Center pane** shows the Claude Code session for whichever workspace is highlighted.
- **Right pane** runs the **companion command** for the highlighted workspace's worktree — [gitui](https://github.com/gitui-org/gitui) by default, or any command you set via `companion_command` (a different git UI, a dev server, a log tailer, …).

### How nested sessions work

Each workspace creates two independent tmux sessions:

- `claude-{repo}-{issue-key}` — runs Claude Code
- `companion-{repo}-{issue-key}` — runs the companion command (gitui by default)

The center and right panes in the Pappardelle session are "viewers" — they run nested tmux clients that attach to these independent sessions. When you highlight a different workspace in the list, Pappardelle uses `tmux switch-client` to instantly swap which session the viewer pane displays.

This means:

- **Workspaces are independent.** Each Claude session runs in its own tmux session. If Pappardelle crashes, your Claude sessions keep running.
- **Attach from anywhere.** You can attach to any workspace's Claude session from a separate terminal: `tmux attach -t claude-stardust-labs-STA-631`.
- **Switching is instant.** After the first attachment, switching between workspaces uses tmux's fast `switch-client` path — no process restart, no visible flash.

### Recommended tmux config

Pappardelle works with any tmux configuration, but these settings improve the experience — mouse support, Ctrl+Shift+arrow pane navigation, and a clean status bar. See [`examples/tmux.conf`](examples/tmux.conf) and append to your `~/.tmux.conf`. If you don't have one yet:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chardigio/pappardelle/main/examples/tmux.conf -o ~/.tmux.conf
```

### Exiting Pappardelle

Press `q` in the workspace list pane to quit. This kills the Pappardelle tmux session and all its viewer panes, returning you to your original terminal. Your Claude and companion workspace sessions are **not** affected — they run in independent tmux sessions and will keep going after Pappardelle exits. To reattach, just run `pappardelle` again.

To also kill all workspace sessions, use `Delete` on each workspace from the TUI before quitting, or nuke everything with:

```bash
tmux kill-server
```

---

## 3. Spawning New Sessions

### From the TUI

Press `n` in the workspace list to open the prompt dialog.

![New session dialog](assets/new-session-dialog.png)

Enter moves focus to a **profile picker** below the prompt, with the
keyword-matched profile already selected — so `Enter`, `Enter` spawns exactly
what the keyword would have chosen on its own. Arrow (or `j`/`k`) to any other
profile to override it without rewording your prompt, and `Esc` to go back to
editing. Issue keys, bare numbers, and Linear URLs skip the picker entirely and
spawn on a single `Enter`, since their profile comes from the issue's tracker
project rather than from your text.

### What gets provisioned

When you create a workspace, Pappardelle runs through these steps:

1. **Profile selection** — Your input is keyword-matched against a profile in `.pappardelle.yml`, and you confirm (or override) the match in the picker.

2. **Issue creation/fetch** — For new descriptions, a Linear (or Jira, or beads) issue is created with a WIP title. For existing issue keys, the issue is fetched.

3. **Git worktree** — An isolated worktree is created at `~/.worktrees/{repo-name}/{issue-key}/`. This is a full working copy of your repo on a new branch, completely isolated from your main checkout.

4. **PR/MR creation** — A placeholder PR (GitHub) or MR (GitLab) is created from the new branch. Its body links back to the tracker issue — or, for beads, names the issue key, since beads issues live in a local database and have no web page.

5. **Project setup** — Profile `commands` are executed (e.g., `xcodegen generate`, dependency installs). Top-level `post_workspace_init` commands also run after the worktree is created (e.g., copying `.env` files).

6. **Claude & companion sessions spawned** — A named tmux session is created and Claude Code is launched inside it. If `claude.initialization_command` is set in `.pappardelle.yml` (e.g., `/do`), that command is passed to Claude along with the issue key. A companion session rooted at the worktree dir is also spawned, running the `companion_command` (gitui by default).

---

## 4. Spec-Driven Development Mindset

![Spec-driven development in Linear](assets/spec-driven-development-linear.png)

Pappardelle's recommended `/do` skill (set via `claude.initialization_command` in `.pappardelle.yml`) starts every Claude session with a **planning-first workflow**. Before writing any code, the agent researches and uses Claude Code's `AskUserQuestion` tool to clarify requirements — asking about ambiguous scope, confirming design decisions, and validating edge cases. The goal is to turn a rough prompt into a detailed, unambiguous spec — **written back to the issue description** — before the first line of code is written.

### Why this matters

A one-line prompt like "add dark mode to settings" leaves a lot of questions open: which settings screen? System preference or manual toggle? What colors? The `/do` skill instructs the agent to surface these questions upfront rather than guessing. This front-loaded clarification produces better code on the first pass and fewer revision cycles.

### Automatic Q&A documentation

Every `AskUserQuestion` exchange is automatically posted as a comment on the Linear, Jira or beads issue by the [`comment-question-answered.py`](hooks/comment-question-answered.py) hook. This means:

- **The issue becomes the single source of truth.** The original prompt, every clarifying question, and every answer are all captured in one place — not scattered across chat windows or terminal scrollback.
- **Anyone reviewing the PR can see the full context.** The issue thread shows exactly what the agent asked, what the developer decided, and why.
- **Record-keeping is automatic.** You don't need to manually document decisions or copy-paste from the terminal. The hook handles it silently in the background.

---

## 5. Customizing Your Configuration

Use `/configure-pappardelle` to interactively edit your config — it walks you through adding profiles, keybindings, hooks, and more using `AskUserQuestion`. Available via the [plugin marketplace](#plugin-marketplace) or by asking Claude directly (it's model-invocable).

Pappardelle is configured via a `.pappardelle.yml` file at your repo root. The key concepts:

- **Issue watchlist** — Auto-discover issues assigned to you and spawn workspaces for them. Pappardelle polls your issue tracker and creates workspaces for new matching issues. Filter by status, labels, or `key_prefixes` (e.g. watch `STA-*` but not `WAB-*` when one account spans multiple workspaces). A profile can also declare its own `issue_watchlist`, polled _in addition_ to the top-level one and auto-scoped to that profile's `team_prefix` — so you can watch one status everywhere and a bespoke status (e.g. "For Pappardelle") for a single project.
- **Auto-remove when done** — Opt-in flag (`auto_remove_when_done: true`) that drops a space from the rail as soon as the tracker reports its issue as completed or canceled. Same teardown as pressing `d`; the on-disk worktree is left untouched.
- **Companion pane command** — The right pane runs `companion_command` (defaults to `gitui`). Set it to any shell command — a different git UI (`companion_command: lazygit`), a dev server, a log tailer — or `""` to leave a plain shell. A profile can override the top-level value, so per-project profiles can each launch their own process.
- **Profiles** — Per-project-type config (keywords, setup commands, VCS labels, optional `emoji:` shown in the ticket rail). Pappardelle keyword-matches your input to auto-select the right profile. Each profile's `tracker_projects` list both routes existing issues to the right profile (Linear project names; Jira project names or keys; beads ID prefixes) and (Linear only) lands brand-new issues in `tracker_projects[0]`.
- **Claude model and effort** — `claude.model` and `claude.effort` are passed straight through to `claude --model` / `--effort` when a workspace's session is created. Set them globally, per-profile, or both — the profile wins, and an explicit `""` on a profile clears an inherited global value. Omit them entirely and nothing changes: no flag is passed and Claude picks its own default.
- **Template variables** — All string values support `${VAR_NAME}` expansion (`${ISSUE_KEY}`, `${WORKTREE_PATH}`, `${PR_URL}`, profile `vars`, env vars, etc.).
- **Custom keybindings** — Bind single keys to bash commands (`run`) or Claude directives (`send_to_claude`).
- **Providers** — Pluggable issue trackers (Linear, Jira, beads) and VCS hosts (GitHub, GitLab). Defaults to Linear + GitHub.
- **Built-in file copies** — `.pappardelle.local.yml` and `.claude/settings.local.json` are automatically copied from the main repo to new worktrees (if they exist).
- **Workspace lifecycle hooks** — `post_workspace_init` commands run after worktree creation (e.g., copying `.env` files, installing dependencies). `pre_workspace_deinit` commands run before workspace deletion (e.g., closing issues, removing worktrees).

For the full schema, all fields, and examples, see the [configuration reference](pappardelle-config.md).

For a production `.pappardelle.yml` used across a polyglot monorepo (Python backends + Swift iOS apps), see [`examples/monorepo-pappardelle.yml`](examples/monorepo-pappardelle.yml).

## 6. Advanced: Doom-coding with Pappardelle

**Video:**

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/824307b7-73a6-48d2-918f-4a2d75fcb39b

Because Pappardelle runs entirely inside tmux, you can access your full workspace setup from anywhere — all you need is an SSH connection to the machine running it.

### What you need

- **A machine that stays on** — I'm not a Mac Mini guy (yet), I just keep my MacBook plugged in. macOS won't sleep with the lid closed as long as it has power and an active SSH session.
- **[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/)** — A mesh VPN that makes your dev machine accessible from any network without port forwarding or firewall configuration. Install on both your dev machine and your mobile device.
- **[Termius](https://termius.com/)** (iOS) — A full-featured SSH client for iPhone and iPad with good tmux support, copy/paste, and keyboard shortcuts.

### Nice-to-haves

- **[ntfy](https://ntfy.sh/)** — Push notifications to your phone when Claude needs input. Pappardelle ships with a [`zap-notification.py`](hooks/zap-notification.py) hook that sends a push via ntfy whenever Claude asks a question or hits a permission prompt. To get it working, set the `PAPPARDELLE_NTFY_TOPIC` environment variable and subscribe to the same topic in the ntfy app on your phone — the hook only fires when an Tailscale SSH session is active. This way you don't have to babysit the terminal — just wait for the buzz.
- **[Wispr Flow](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wispr-flow-ai-voice-keyboard/id6497229487)** — Voice-to-text dictation that works system-wide, including inside Termius. Lets you talk to Claude instead of thumb-typing on a phone keyboard.

### Recommended Termius keyboard shortcuts

Termius lets you customize the shortcut bar above the on-screen keyboard — these are my favorite groups for Pappardelle:

![Termius keyboard shortcuts](assets/termius-keyboard-shortcuts.jpg)

- **Arrow keys** — scroll through Claude output and navigate the workspace list
- **pgUp / pgDn** — cycle between tmux panes (requires the `PageUp`/`PageDown` bindings from [`examples/tmux.conf`](examples/tmux.conf))
- **esc / ^C** — cancel prompts, exit modes
- **paste / tab / ctrl / alt** — general terminal essentials

Also recommended: toggle on **Settings > Hide the AI widget** in Termius for extra screen real estate.

### Useful keybindings

When you're doom-coding from your phone, you want one-tap access to open the PR on the device in your hand. Bind a key that sends an ntfy notification with a clickable link:

```yaml
keybindings:
  - key: 'z'
    name: 'Zap PR'
    # Use `--search "head:${ISSUE_KEY}"` (tokenized prefix match) rather than
    # `--head ${ISSUE_KEY}` (exact match) so follow-up branches like
    # ${ISSUE_KEY}-FOLLOW-1 are also discoverable from the parent issue key.
    # Sort by updatedAt desc — when a branch name has been reused (e.g. an
    # old merged PR + a freshly opened one), surface the PR you're actually
    # working on, not the oldest stale match.
    run: >
      PR_JSON=$(gh pr list --search "head:${ISSUE_KEY}" --state all --json number,url,updatedAt
        -q 'sort_by(.updatedAt) | reverse | .[0]' 2>/dev/null);
      PR_NUM=$(echo "$PR_JSON" | jq -r '.number // empty');
      PR_URL=$(echo "$PR_JSON" | jq -r '.url // empty');
      if [ -n "$PR_NUM" ]; then
        curl -d "${ISSUE_KEY} GitHub PR #$PR_NUM"
          -H "Click: $PR_URL"
          ntfy.sh/${PAPPARDELLE_NTFY_TOPIC};
      fi
```

Press `z` on a workspace and your phone buzzes with a notification — tap it and the PR opens in the GitHub app.

## 7. Advanced: Wrangling Multi-Repo Changes

Pappardelle is designed for single-repo workflows, but (experimentally) you can extend it to orchestrate changes across multiple repositories using a parent (pappa) repo.

### The setup

Create a parent repository that serves as the orchestration hub:

```
my-workspace/
├── .pappardelle.yml
├── .claude/
│   ├── settings.json         # shared settings + plugins
│   └── skills/
│       ├── do/
│       │   └── SKILL.md      # initialization skill
│       └── address-mr-feedbacks/
│           └── SKILL.md      # orchestration skill
└── CLAUDE.md
```

The parent repo's primary purpose is to share settings, context, and orchestration skills to coordinate work across child repos. Child repos are **not** committed to the parent — they're shallow-cloned on demand during workspace setup.

### Spawning agents in child repos

Multi-repo work has been an achilles heel for Claude Code in the past, but I'm hoping **[Agent Teams](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams)** can help solve this. One key unlock with agent teams is that teammates can be spawned in _separate directories_, meaning we can have a parent repo, but then spawn an agent per relevant child repo, which is nice because it automatically loads that repo's CLAUDE.md, skills, settings, etc.

### On-demand shallow cloning

Repos are pulled down as needed, not upfront. During the planning phase, use a search tool like SourceBot's `codesearch` MCP to identify which repos are relevant, then shallow-clone only what you need:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/org/repo-a.git
```

This keeps initialization fast and reduces noise for the agent while it greps and globs. Because we use `--depth 1`, only the latest commit is fetched — no full history.

### Plugin skills vs. parent repo skills

One key distinction for multi-repo work is between plugin skills and parent repo skills:

- **Plugin skills** (added in the parent repo's `settings.json` but defined elsewhere) are skills that can be used by any repo / agent teammate receives automatically. These handle single-repo concerns.

  Example: An `/address-mr-feedback` plugin that lets any agent look at its own repo's MR and address reviewer comments.

- **Parent repo skills** (in the parent repo's `.claude/skills/`) are orchestration skills that spawn agent teams across child repos.

  Example: An `/address-mr-feedbacks` (plural) skill that spins up an agent team, spawning one agent per relevant child repo — each agent calls the plugin's singular skill for its own MR.

### Example `/do` skill for multi-repo

A starter `/do` skill tailored for multi-repo workflows is available at [`examples/skills/do-multi-repo/SKILL.md`](examples/skills/do-multi-repo/SKILL.md). It covers shallow cloning, agent team spin-up, per-repo QA, and coordinated PR creation. Install it into your parent repo with:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills/do && curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chardigio/pappardelle/main/examples/skills/do-multi-repo/SKILL.md -o .claude/skills/do/SKILL.md
```

### Useful keybindings

Bind keys to open specific child repos in your editor for quick navigation:

```yaml
keybindings:
  - key: 's'
    name: 'Open repo-a in Cursor'
    run: 'open -a "Cursor" "${WORKTREE_PATH}/repo-a" 2>/dev/null || open -a "Cursor" "${REPO_ROOT}/repo-a"'
```

Note the fallback to `${REPO_ROOT}/repo-a` here ensures this shortcut works in the `master`/`main` space.

### Manual installation

If you prefer to install without the `/init-pappardelle` skill:

**One-line install:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chardigio/pappardelle/main/install.sh | bash
```

**From a local clone:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chardigio/pappardelle.git
cd pappardelle
./install.sh
```

> **Node pinning:** the installer pins the `pappardelle` command to the node binary it
> verified at install time — PATH in non-interactive shells often differs (nvm/volta
> don't load there), which used to silently bind the shim to a stale system node. If
> you later remove that node version (e.g. `nvm uninstall`), the shim falls back to
> PATH and refuses to run anything below Node 18 — just re-run the installer (or press
> `U` in the TUI) to re-pin.

**Manual install:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chardigio/pappardelle.git
cd pappardelle
npm install
npm run build
npm link                # makes `pappardelle` available globally
./hooks/install.sh      # installs Claude Code hooks for status tracking
```

**Directories created by the installer:**

| Directory / File                                   | Purpose                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `~/.pappardelle/`                                  | Config, hooks, logs, and Claude status files              |
| `~/.pappardelle/repos/{repoName}/open-spaces.json` | Persisted workspace registry (per-repo, survives reboots) |
| `~/.pappardelle/repos/{repoName}/issue-meta/`      | Issue metadata for hook tracking (per-repo)               |
| `~/.pappardelle/claude-status/`                    | Real-time status JSON files from Claude hooks             |
| `~/.pappardelle/logs/`                             | Daily log files (7-day retention)                         |
| `~/.worktrees/`                                    | Git worktrees for all your workspaces                     |

> **Multi-repo support:** State is namespaced per repository under `~/.pappardelle/repos/{repoName}/`.
> Running pappardelle in two different repos keeps their workspace registries completely separate.
> On first run, existing state is automatically migrated from the legacy global location.

### Claude Code hooks

Pappardelle installs three Claude Code hooks that provide integration between Claude sessions and the TUI:

| Hook                           | Trigger                             | What it does                                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `update-status.py`             | `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `Stop` | Writes session status to `~/.pappardelle/claude-status/` for live TUI updates |
| `comment-question-answered.py` | `PostToolUse` (AskUserQuestion)     | Posts Q&A exchanges as comments on the issue (Linear, Jira, or beads)         |
| `zap-notification.py`          | `PreToolUse`, `PermissionRequest`   | Sends push notifications via ntfy when Claude needs user input                |

### Versioning and updates

Pappardelle is versioned via git tags on `chardigio/pappardelle` (`vX.Y.Z`) — `package.json` is not bumped on release. Every push to `main` cuts a new tag + GitHub Release via the `release` workflow. Bump type is driven by PR labels:

| Label           | Effect               |
| --------------- | -------------------- |
| `release:major` | `X.0.0` bump         |
| `release:minor` | `x.Y.0` bump         |
| `release:patch` | `x.y.Z` bump         |
| _(no label)_    | patch bump (default) |

Two paths feed the release workflow:

- **Direct merge on `chardigio/pappardelle`** — an external contributor opens a PR here and you merge it. The release workflow reads the `release:*` label on the chardigio-side PR directly.
- **Forward sync from `stardust-labs-io/stardust-labs`** — rsync pushes straight to `main` with no PR on this side. The monorepo's sync workflow reads the merged _monorepo_ PR's `release:*` label and propagates it to the synced commit as a `Release-bump: <major|minor|patch>` trailer, which the release workflow here consumes.

On startup, the TUI checks the GitHub Releases API (cached for 24h at `~/.pappardelle/update-check.json`) and, if a newer tag is available, renders a magenta banner above the workspace list:

```
Update available: v0.1.0 → v0.2.0 · U to update · X to dismiss
```

The update-check's installed version is read from `git describe --tags --abbrev=0 --match 'v*.*.*'` on the install clone. Press `U` to update to the latest release. `U` is **always live** — not just while the banner is showing: the 24h cache can lag a fresh release by hours, so you can pull a release that landed minutes ago without restarting and waiting out the cache. `U` opens an "are you sure?" confirm dialog (same style as closing a space); confirming exits the TUI, re-runs the install script in-place, and relaunches. Press `X` to dismiss the banner for the current session — the next launch re-reads the cache.

The version shown in the help (`?`) overlay follows the same source-of-truth but degrades differently, since `package.json` is never bumped on release and so is always a stale `0.1.0`:

- **Released install** (run from `~/.pappardelle/repo`, which carries the tag) → `pappardelle v0.7.9 (<sha>)`.
- **Dev / worktree build** (run from the monorepo, where no `v*.*.*` tag is reachable) → reports the latest release you have installed, flagged `-dev`: `pappardelle v0.7.9-dev (<sha>)`. This signals "ahead of v0.7.9" rather than leaking the stale `0.1.0`.
- **Neither resolvable** → the line degrades to the sha-only form `pappardelle (<sha>)`.

When running out of the stardust-labs monorepo (`LOCAL_MODE`), the **automatic** update check (and its banner) is skipped — the monorepo's version is a dev placeholder, so the comparison would false-positive on every launch. The manual `U` update still works everywhere: the installer writes to `~/.pappardelle/repo`, never to your monorepo checkout, so it can't clobber unpushed work there.

### Logging

Logs are written to `~/.pappardelle/logs/` with daily rotation (7-day retention):

```bash
# View today's log
cat ~/.pappardelle/logs/pappardelle-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).log

# Tail logs in real-time
tail -f ~/.pappardelle/logs/pappardelle-*.log

# View errors only
grep '\[ERROR\]' ~/.pappardelle/logs/*.log
```

Warnings and errors also appear in a red box at the bottom of the TUI. Press `e` to view them.

### Development

```bash
npm run dev      # Watch mode (auto-rebuild on changes)
npm run build    # Build once
npm start        # Run without building
npm test         # Lint + format check + tests
```

### Integration tests

Standalone scripts in `integration-tests/` verify providers against real instances. They are **not** ava tests and are never run in CI — use them for local verification after making provider changes.

```bash
npx tsx integration-tests/verify-linear.ts     # Linear provider (linctl)
npx tsx integration-tests/verify-jira.ts       # Jira provider (acli)
npx tsx integration-tests/verify-beads.ts      # Beads provider (bd, read-only by default)
npx tsx integration-tests/verify-github.ts     # GitHub PR detection (gh)
npx tsx integration-tests/verify-gitlab.ts     # GitLab MR detection (glab)
npx tsx integration-tests/verify-config.ts     # Config loading + validation
npx tsx integration-tests/verify-watchlist.ts  # Full watchlist pipeline end-to-end
npx tsx integration-tests/verify-comments.ts   # Comment posting (creates real comments)
```

See [`integration-tests/README.md`](integration-tests/README.md) for env vars and prerequisites.

### Plugin Marketplace

Pappardelle ships a [Claude Code plugin marketplace](plugins/) with a single `pappardelle` plugin containing four skills:

| Skill                    | Description                                                                                                                                            | Model-invocable |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| `/init-pappardelle`      | Interactive setup wizard — installs Pappardelle, checks prerequisites, generates `.pappardelle.yml`                                                    | No              |
| `/update-pappardelle`    | Re-runs the install script to update Pappardelle to the latest version                                                                                 | No              |
| `/configure-pappardelle` | Interactive config editor for `.pappardelle.yml` and `.pappardelle.local.yml` — profiles, keybindings, hooks, watchlists, and more                     | Yes             |
| `/sous-chef`             | Kitchen-style coordinator — quick overview of active spaces, drill into any space for a sitrep, relay instructions to running Claude sessions via tmux | No              |

**Install the plugin:**

```bash
claude /plugin marketplace add chardigio/pappardelle
```

```bash
claude /plugin install pappardelle@pappardelle-marketplace
```

Because `/configure-pappardelle` is model-invocable, Claude will automatically offer to use it when you ask about configuring Pappardelle — no need to invoke it explicitly.
